  "description": "\"Los Muros más altos\" is a song of indeterminate genre. It's an experiment that plays with various elements recorded live. I sing in Spanish and live (without any autotune or correction) accompanied by a vocoder. The lyrics speak metaphorically about the barriers we create to protect ourselves from emotional harm, even that which is done unconsciously. The female choir, also performed live without any correction, was composed and interpreted by A. Pinkevych"
