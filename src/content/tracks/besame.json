  "description": "\"Besame\" is a techno track. It is structured around two seemingly different movements that are ultimately combined thanks to common basic musical elements. It tries to express how we are not as different as we may seem, after all, we all kiss when we love each other. (Which I think is nicer than saying that we all bleed when we are hit)."
