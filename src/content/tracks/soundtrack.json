  "description": "\"Soundtrack\" is an epic electro piece. It aims to express the grandeur of a collective endeavor where the goal is far more significant than individual egos, through the combination of elements that all drive the song in the same direction. The ending conveys that the endeavor doesn't stop, as there is always a new challenge, a new frontier."
