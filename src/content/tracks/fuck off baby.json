  "description": "\"Fuck of Baby\" is a slow dance song, meant for close dancing. It features three vocal lines. The first one, in Spanish, emotionally expresses the evolution of love from a romantic perspective. The second, in English, discusses the denial of a breakup and the hope for reconciliation. The third, also in English, speaks of the confirmation of the breakup and the need to move on. A unique feature is that at one point in the song, the two English vocal lines merge into a polyphonic chorus, expressing that all-too-common moment in breakups where one person wants to return while the other does not."
