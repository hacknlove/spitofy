  "description": "\"We will never die\" is a dance song about the incomparable joy of being with the love of your life. It's a feeling of blissful contentment enveloped in a sense of unique and magical connection, where the world fades away, leaving only the two of you in your own private universe, no matter how crowded the room, because you and your beloved are all that truly matter to one another, like two stars so close that they orbit around each other, existing in the midst of the immense galactic void, brimming with other stars that mean absolutely nothing for you."
